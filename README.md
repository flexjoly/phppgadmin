I have noticed some bugs when I use phppgadmin. I use PHP 7 and I got messages which indicate that using the same name for functions and classes is deprecated. This bug is normally fixed now.

Furthermore, each() function is deprecated in PHP 7.2 ; I am correcting the code to make it compatible with this new version.
